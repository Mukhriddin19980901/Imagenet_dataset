ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that is part of the ResNet (Residual Network) family, developed by Microsoft Research. It is known for its deep structure and effectiveness in image recognition tasks, particularly in the context of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC).
ResNet-50 is effective due to its deep architecture, which allows it to capture increasingly complex patterns in the input images. The use of residual blocks enables training of very deep networks without encountering the degradation problem, leading to improved accuracy in image recognition tasks.
